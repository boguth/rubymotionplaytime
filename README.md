# rubymotionplaytime
This is my playground for RubyMotion iOS projects.

##Requirements
- Xcode updated to most recent version.
- RubyMotion (check email for key)
- An iOS Developer account so that you can provision apps (having a provisioned app is necessary if you want to run/test it on a device or sell it on the app store). This costs 99$.
